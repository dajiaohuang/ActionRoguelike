# Melee Combat System

The game includes Melee attacks for enemy AI behaviors. The melee system builds on the Action System (similar to GAS) and uses Behavior Trees to initiate the logic to run up and perform the melee attack.

**Walkthrough**
- The Enemy's BehaviorTree checks if target (player) is within certain distance, and initiate melee attack sequence (run closer then attack when in attack range)
- **[RogueAction_MinionMeleeAttack](https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/AI/RogueAction_MinionMeleeAttack.cpp)** (Action) handles the start/stop of the attack. Runs an AnimMontage with the attack animation. 
- **[RogueAnimationInstance](https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Animation/RogueAnimInstance.cpp)** (AnimBlueprint) contains *OnMeleeOverlap* which the Melee Attack Action listens for.
- **[RogueAnimNotifyState_Melee](https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Animation/RogueAnimNotifyState_Melee.cpp)** (AnimNotify) broadcasts *OnMeleeOverlap* event when an melee overlap is found by running *OverlapMultiByChannel* colision query while the AnimNotify is active.
  - **game.drawdebugmelee 1** to visualize the overlap shape during melee attack.
  - OnMeleeOverlap is handled by the Melee Attack Action to apply Damage to the hit target.

Note: The AnimMontage holds a Melee Attack animation and requires the custom AnimNotify in order to handle the overlap checks.

# Performance & Optimization

## Animation Budget Allocator
 
Animation Budget Allocator plugin for the enemy AI. Define the allocated animation budget using scalability CVAR (**a.Budget.BudgetMs**) inside **DefaultScalability.ini**. View the budgeting debug and profiling information using **a.Budget.Debug.Enabled** and **stat AnimationBudgetAllocator**. The ARogueAICharacter class includes the optional OnReduceAnimationWork callback to allow custom logic to further throttle anim quality when necessary.

Read more on the [Animation Budget Allocator Docs Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-budget-allocator-in-unreal-engine) which contains all the steps to implement this in your own projects.

# Browsing Older Releases

The project is ocassionally updated to keep up with the latest Unreal Engine release. Additionally, new features are sometimes added to the project, often related to new Articles or Tutorials posted on [tomlooman.com](https://tomlooman.com). These will be included on the main branch, on whatever the latest UE version is at the time.

**For C++ Course Students: You may use branch "Lecture29-FinishedProject" for finished course code without additions all the way back to UE4.25**
